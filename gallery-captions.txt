Landtech -
I built the About page for this site to a responsive grid using TailwindCSS and used Laravel Blade to componentise the sections for use across the site.

LBA -
This was a demo project in which I rebuilt the homepage of the LBA site that Parallax had just completed. I used Gulp build tooling and PostCSS on this project.

Present & Correct -
I rebuilt the homepage of one of my favourite online stores as a practice project. I used the dropdown menus as an opportunity to learn more about using JS for DOM manipulation.
